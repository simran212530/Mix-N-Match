### Abstract
The aim of this project is to develop a CLI Interface to blend
two input images. The motivation for this project arose due

to an extremely rare occurrence while capturing your mem-
ories through photos by almost everyone: the pursuit of the

perfect photo. It is a most common occurrence to find your
pictures where either your eyes are not open, or you are not
smiling nicely, or a thousand other issues. We have come at
a solution to face swap your face from pictures where you

look fantastic on pictures where some disturbance has oc-
curred. For various purposes, face swapping synthesizing

is becoming famous. We aim to analyse feature selection
using image blending techniques and preserve the principal
parts of the two overlapping images.[2]
